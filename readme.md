# Python Blog

The project is a blog application built with Python using the Flask framework and PostgreSQL for the database.

The application allows users to create and manage blog posts. The data for these posts is stored in a PostgreSQL database, a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. The application includes features such as user authentication, form validation, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts. The project demonstrates a good understanding of web development principles, MVC architecture, the Flask framework, and database management with PostgreSQL.
